# Code formatting
To prevent git conflicts and ugly histories, please always format your code with the eclipse formatter ```ctrl+shift+f```. Unfortunately, unlike for Java projects, eclipse does not provide an automatic formatting at saving a file. Therefore please try to get used to always press a combination of ```ctrl+s``` and ```ctrl+shift+f```!

# File structure
The L1 and L2 specific algorithms should be implemented within the folders ```l1``` and ```l2```. Code that is shared by L1 and L2 should be stored in ```common```. Within all these three folders code related to one detector should always be stored in a detector specific folder as in ```l1/straw/``` unless the code is supposed to be reused by other detectors.

# Code conventions
Here's a rough list of conventions I try to stick to:
 - CamelCase (don't use '_' in Methode/Variable names expect in following point)
 - Instance variables are lower case and end with ```_``` e.g. ```int someVar_;```
 - Class names are capitalized as in ```class SomeClass {```
 - Method names are in lower case e.g. ```void doSomething() {```

## C++11
Use c++11 syntax and objects like in following examples:
- Range-based loops:
```
std::vector<int> v = someFunction();
for (int i: v) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

- Type inference: 
```
auto myMap = getSomeMap();
for (auto& keyValue : myMap) {
    std::cout << "Key: "<< keyValue.first << ", value: " << keyValue.second << std::endl;
}
```

- Use move semantics and rvalue references:
```
void addElement(Element&& e) {
    myVector.push_back(std::move(e));
}
```

- Use ```std::unordered_set``` and ```std::unordered_map``` with O(const) access time instead of the binary tree implementations (```std::set``` and ```std::map```) with O(n*log(n)) access time if you have large collections.

- Consider using ```std::unique_ptr```, ```std::shared_ptr``` and  ```std::make_shared```

- Nested constructors: 
```
class MyClass  {
    int num_;
public:
    MyClass(int theNumber) : num_(theNumber) {}
    MyClass() : MyClass(23) {}
};
```

- Use ```nullptr``` instead of ```NULL``` 
- Initializer lists: ```MyStruct vector = {0.23f, 42.5f};```
