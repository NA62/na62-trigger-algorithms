# Guideline

If you want to develop trigger algorithms that should run in the PC-farm, you need to clone this repository and na62-farm-lib. As these are eclipse projects you should import them into your eclipse workspace. Testing the algorithms should be done by cloning [[na62-trigger-test|https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-test/wiki]] which links this project and na62-farm-lib.

# Getting the code
For a more advanced way to clone the code within the PC-farm see [[this link|https://github.com/NA62/na62-farm/wiki/Development]]
## Forking within github
The best way to start with your trigger implementations is to create a github account and then fork this project (See [[this link|https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-algorithms/fork]] on the top right hand corner).

Then you can clone your forked repository via (please adjust YourUserName with your github user name)
```
git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/na62-trigger-algorithms.git
```

Don't forget to upload your ssh-key before cloning!

After you've implemented your changes you can send a Pull Request. I will have a look at your commits and accept the request asap.

## Cloning directly
If you don't want to contribute to the project but only run it you can directly clone the code via 
```
git clone https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-algorithms.git
```

## git branches
All PC-Farm frameworks are developed based on the git flow paradigm. To get familiar with git and git flow please see following links:
 * http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/ (a game to easily learn git)
 * http://nvie.com/posts/a-git-flow-screencast/ (video about git flow)
 * http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/ (more about git flow)

The short summary would be:
Always code in specific branches like ```feature/yourFeature``` where ```yourFeature``` should describe the feature you're currently developing. I recommend to install the git-flow package so that you can use following commands:
 * ```git flow init``` (use standard settings)
 * ```git flow feature start yourFeature```
 * ```git flow feature finish yourFeature```

# Dependencies
The trigger-algorithms project is only a library linked by na62-trigger-test and linking another library called na62-farm-lib. To install these dependencies please do following:
```
git clone https://github.com/NA62/na62-farm-lib.git
git clone https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-test.git
```

Additionally you need to have boost 1.55 and tbb installed:
```bash
# Debian:
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev libboost1.55-all-dev
```

Running on lxplus.cern.ch you can use the ```lxplus``` configuration of na62-trigger-test and add following to your ```.bashrc```:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Boost/1.55.0_python2.7/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Example installation
If ```YourGitHubUserName``` is your github username, you've forked na62-trigger-algorithms and ```YourFeature``` is the name of the detector or special feature you'd like to write code for, following should be the right commands for you:

```
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-test.git
git clone https://github.com/NA62/na62-farm-lib.git
git clone git@github.com:YourGitHubUserName/na62-trigger-algorithms.git
cd na62-trigger-algorithms
git flow feature start YourFeature
git push --all
# Write your code
# Commit as often as possible (typically O(10) times a day)
git commit -am "Your commit message"
git push
```

## Compiler
So far all na62-farm projects are tested with gcc 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9. As c++11 is heavily used it is not possible to use any gcc compiler below 4.6.

### At CERN
On SLC6 with AFS running you can activate gcc 4.9 as follows
```
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/gcc/4.9.0/x86_64-slc6/setup.sh
```

It is recommended to add this to your .bashrc:
```
echo "source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/gcc/4.9.0/x86_64-slc6/setup.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### gcc 4.6
To use gcc 4.6 you need to compile with ```--std=c++0x``` instead of ```--std=c++11```. This is easily possible by using the gcc4.6 configuration in eclipse:
Just activate the gcc4.6 configuration by right-clicking the na62-trigger-test project and selecting ```Build Configurations -> Set Active -> gcc4.6```

# Compiling
## Installing Eclipse
As all projects are Eclipse projects, please install Eclipse with CDT ([[link|https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]]):
```
wget http://ftp.fau.de/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/luna/R/eclipse-cpp-luna-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf eclipse-cpp*.tar.gz -C /usr/share/
sudo ln -s /usr/share/eclipse/eclipse /usr/bin/
```

## Importing the projects
In eclipse click `File->Import->General->"Existing Projects into Workspace"`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NA62/na62-farm-docs/master/wiki-images/eclipse/importProjects.png)

Now click `Browse` and select the folder with all the cloned projects. After pressing `OK` you should see something like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NA62/na62-farm-docs/master/wiki-images/eclipse/importProjects2.png)

Now Click Finish and you should see the projects in the "Project Explorer" view.

## Building and running
For the initial building you should select any cpp file of the na62-trigger-test project and click `Project->Build Project` or build all Projects by pressing `CTRL+b`.

If you want to test trigger algorithms you have to execute the [[trigger-test project|https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-test/wiki]] project. Therefore select any file out of this project and click the green run button at the bar at the top.

## Configuring trigger-test
 Some of the available options for this program are:
<dl>
  <dt>rawInputPath</dt>
  <dd>Path to the directory containing all the raw binary files to be read (see [[InputFileFormat|https://github.com/NA62/na62-trigger-test/wiki/InputFileFormat]])</dd>
  <dt>activeSourceIDs</dt>
  <dd>List of Source IDs to be used</dd>
  <dt>maxEventNum</dt>
  <dd>Maximum number of events to be processed</dd>
</dl>
To specify these options while running within eclipse, you should click the right button next to the run button and then `Run Configurations`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NA62/na62-farm-docs/master/wiki-images/eclipse/runConfigs.png)

After selecting the `na62-trigger-test` under `C/C++ Application` you need to select the `Arguments` tab where you can add all the arguments you like:
